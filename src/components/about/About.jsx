      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello! I’m Sharath, and I’m passionate about
        creating web applications that truly make a difference. With experience
        in both front-end and back-end development, I strive to build solutions
        that are not only functional but also enjoyable for users.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My journey began with a simple “Hello, World!”
        program, and as I tackled more complex projects, I fell in love with web
        development. This field allows me to directly enhance user experiences
        and solve real-world problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I specialize in the MERN stack—MongoDB,
        Express.js, React, and Node.js—and have had the pleasure of working on a
        variety of exciting projects. These experiences have honed my ability to
        transform complex requirements into intuitive, user-friendly solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What drives me is the opportunity to create
        meaningful impact through technology. I am committed to continuous
        learning, with certifications in web design, JavaScript, and backend
        development to stay current with the latest technologies and trends.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m eager to collaborate and build impactful web
        applications together. Let’s connect and create something great!
